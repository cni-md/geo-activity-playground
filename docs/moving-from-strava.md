# Moving from Strava

If you have been using Strava up to this point but want to use this project from now on, this is the correct guide. Here I will show how you can convert your data from Strava into the format of this project and keep adding new data without Strava in the future.

## Download your archive from Strava

Go to the [Strava account download page](https://www.strava.com/athlete/delete_your_account) and request a download of your data. This will take a while and you get a notification via e-mail when it is done.

Once it has run through, you will be able to download a ZIP file. Once extracted, it will have a structure like this:

```

└── visibility_settings.csv
```

This directory contains a file `activities.csv` with the metadata and also a directory `activities` with the files that you have recorded.

## Convert your checkout

Use the following command to create a directory from your Strava actitivies:

```bash
geo-activity-playground convert-strava-checkout ~/Downloads/export_123456/ ~/Documents/Outdoors/Playground
```

This should read through all the activities and create a directory structure with the pattern `~/Documents/Outdoors/Playground/Activities/{Kind}/{Equipment}/{Commute}/{Date} {Time} {Name}.{Suffix}`. For instance one file might be named `Activities/Run/5212701.0/2019-07-09 09-59-25 Around the 北京大学 campus.gpx.gz`.

The equipment might have nonsensical seeming names like `10370891.0`. The problem here is that Strava doesn't export the list of activities with that index. If your equipment doesn't have a nickname, it will just be such a number.

## Use the directory

Now that the files from Strava are converted, consult the [guide on using activity files](import-activity-files.md) to proceed from here.

## Recording more activities

Now that you don't record via Strava, you will need some other app to [record activities](record-activities.md)..
