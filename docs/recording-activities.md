# Recording activities

Here you will learn ways to record outdoor activities such that you can analyze them with Geo Activity Playground later on.

There are many different ways to record activities. These are a couple of suggestions:

- Use [OsmAnd](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.osmand) on an Android phone, enable the GPX recording extension and record your activities. Export the recorded tracks as GPX files into the file manager or Google Drive.
- Use [OpenTracks](https://f-droid.org/de/packages/de.dennisguse.opentracks/) on an Android phone and set up auto-export as GPX.
- Create an account with [Strava](https://www.strava.com/) and use the [Strava App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.strava) on Android or iOS to record your activities.
- Use an outdoor device that records activities and transfer activities to your computer via an USB cable or Strava integration. For instance the Garmin Venu Sq smartwatch records FIT files that can be accessed via the USB cable. (It also supports Strava via the Garmin app.)
