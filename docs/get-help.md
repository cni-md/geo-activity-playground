# Get Help

If you get stuck at any point, have an idea for a feature or would like to get in contact for any other reason, please feel free to do so.

This is a hobby tinkering project of Martin Ueding. I create this in my free time, mostly for myself and also for others. This is not a polished product, hence it is quite natural that you might find some rough edges.

You can [open a ticket](https://github.com/martin-ueding/geo-activity-playground/issues) via GitHub (preferred) or write an e-mail to <mu@martin-ueding.de>. It might take a while until I can answer, but I usually answer every request.
