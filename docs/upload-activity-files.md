# Upload Activity Files

Some users don't want to restart the application each time they add new activities but run it on their home server. For this use case you can upload activities. This is protected by login, you have to set a password in the settings and log in.

Once set up, you can upload new files which will be placed into the `Activities` directory within the base directory. If you have subdirectories there, you can also select them during the upload.

After an activity is uploaded, it will be added to the database and displayed.
